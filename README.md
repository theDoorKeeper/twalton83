### She codes, she learns

I'm a MERN stack web developer with a lot of ideas, and so little time to execute. Forever wishing for just a few more hours in the day. I make things that are in my interests, so my public facing repos are often centered around video games, food, or just anything I might find personally useful. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced React concepts, and Redux. I am also dabbling in PHP. 
- ðŸ›’ I am also a Shopify Partner, so I make Liquid templates and honestly love this niche. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her/Hers
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a bit of a gamer, but I can't say I play anything incredibly interesting a la Fortnite, Warzone, Fall Guys, etc.
