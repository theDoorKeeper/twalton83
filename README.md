I am a junior MERN stack developer. I thought I'd fall in love with front-end, but back-end caught my eye and it has been a whirlwind romance ever since. Connecting a lot of moving pieces together is my bread and butter, and brings me joy and satisfaction. JavaScript is a great tool that I have come to love, and Python is vying for first place in my heart too. Overall, I love to learn, and want to learn everything I can!
