I'm a MERN stack web developer with a passion for learning. Forever wishing for just a few more hours in the day to check out something new.

- üå± I‚Äôm currently working on a few full stack projects, leveraging MongoDB, Express, Node, and React. I have a running list of technologies I want to dive into, including React Native and Electron. Sometimes you might catch me tinkering with Python on my Raspberry Pi. 
- I have also recently come to love Vue, although React ‚öõÔ∏è has my heart. I like to try a lot of different things, and am happy to pick up the right tool for the job!
- üõí I am also a Shopify Partner/Theme Developer, but I also want to make some useful Shopify Apps with Polaris.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I am a bit of a gamer, but I can't say I play anything incredibly interesting a la Fortnite, Warzone, Fall Guys, etc. I am more of a chill farming RPG type of girl. I just want to till my turnips on a Saturday afternoon after spending my morning programming.
