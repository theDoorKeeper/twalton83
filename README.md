### She codes, she learns

I'm a MERN stack web developer with a passion for learning. Forever wishing for just a few more hours in the day to check out something new.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced React concepts, and Redux. I am also dabbling in PHP. 
- ðŸ›’ I am also a Shopify Partner/Theme Developer, but I also want to make some useful Shopify Apps with Polaris
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her/Hers
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a bit of a gamer, but I can't say I play anything incredibly interesting a la Fortnite, Warzone, Fall Guys, etc. I am more of a chill farming RPG type of girl.
